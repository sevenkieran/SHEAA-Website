                        In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), ensuring the robustness and reliability of
                        models is crucial for their effective deployment in real-world applications. One key aspect of
                        assessing the performance of NLP models is to evaluate their ability to handle errors and
                        provide accurate results with errors injected into their nodes. More specifically we are looking
                        to see how NLP Models handle hardware level bit errors. We are doing this by simulating errors
                        with three novel error injection methods. <br>

                        Developers do not fully understand the limits of AI.
                        When talking about the limits of AI, Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, has said
                    <blockquote>"we've got to
                        be
                        careful" and "I think [the general public] should be happy
                        that we are a little bit scared of this."</blockquote> This highlights the importance of
                    investigating the
                    limits and Robustness of NLP models.
                    More toolkits are needed to understand the robustness of AI.

                                To simulate hardware errors pur team is focusing on bit flips which are flips in a

                                by manufacturing errors or random transient events. This has been known to happen is
                                real life. <br> <br>
                                A cosmic ray from space came down and hit a transistor on the hardware that the e-voting
                                system was being run on which caused the 13th bit of the number that controlled the
                                votes for one candidate to switch from a 0 to a 1, increasing that vote tally by 4096
                                (2^12) votes.
                                This increase in votes was due to a bit flip from 0 to 1. <br><br>
                                With AI models becoming more important in society's daily life, understanding the impact

                                The project is broken down into three different Error injection methods: Auto Error
                                Injection, Manual Error Injection, and Single Bit Error Injection. These errors are
                                injected into the layers of the Neural Network of the Natural Language Model. We have
                                built functionality with multiple models, the most interesting being GPT-2 and Bart.

                            <p>The main goals of error injection methods were to keep quick responses to better
                                accomodate website integration. Quick responses are also important to consider when
                                running error injection over a long time if this project were to be developed into a
                                benchmark tool.

                                Another important goal was to avoid over-injection as this represents unlikely scenarios
                                that NLP models would almost never have to endure in normal circumstances. With
                                over-injection, the results tend to lose their variety and become quite repetetive and
                                illegible. Random symbols and punctuation are also a sign of over-injection.

                    <h3>Auto Error Injection</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>
                            Our first method of error injection is Auto Error Injection which takes in the number of
                            parameters you want changed and what you want them changed to. It operates by looking
                            for the most important nodes and it then changes the value of the entire tensor to the
                            value that you have given. <br><br>There are significant limitations with this method
                            one of
                            them is over-injection where the model will almost always spit out gibberish due to the
                            most important nodes being changed. Another important limitation is the lack of variety
                            of outputs, due to the node that is chosen being changed to the same value no matter how
                            often you run it, it will give back the same result.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Manual Error Injection</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>
                            The next method of error injection is Manual Error Injection which takes in a model,
                            the
                            node that you want to attack, scale factor which affects the error injection rate,
                            and
                            dropout rate which affects randomness and introduces another way to prevent over
                            injection.<br><br>
                            This attack works by creating an error mask which takes the size of the tensor of
                            the
                            node that is being attacked, generates a tensor of that size that contains powers of
                            two,
                            uses dropout and scalefactor to introduce randomness, and then injects the errors
                            through
                            XOR.
                            <br><br>
                            The benefits of this injector is primarily with its targeting capabilities; you are
                            able
                            to
                            choose individual nodes that make up the model and attack them. This lets us isolate
                            nodes
                            and once injected will tell us how significant they really are. We have not explored
                            the
                            full capabilities of testing this with every node of a model and it may lead to a
                            deeper
                            understanding of how NLPs operate if done.

                    <h3>Single Bit Error Injection</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>The final method of error injection is Bit Flip Injector which takes in the index
                            of the node
                            you
                            want changed from the total list of nods in the model and how many you want
                            changed. It
                            operates by converting all elements of the tensor specified by the user to
                            binary then
                            flipping
                            the number of bits specified by the user and converting all elements back to
                            decimal. This
                            new
                            tensor replaces the old tensor in a modified model.

                            The main benefit of this injector is its subtlety. When slightly increasing the
                            number of
                            bits
                            to flip, the output of the model becomes more and more distorted. This is
                            especially helpful
                            in
                            finding the breaking point of the model, where grammar and spelling mistakes
                            become complete
                            gibberish. Another benefit is that you can specifically choose which tensor to
                            alter,
                            allowing
                            the user to see the impact each tensor has.
